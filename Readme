## 🚀 How to Run

### 1️⃣ **Run CLI Interface**

```bash
python app.py
```

When prompted, enter `C` (CLI) to launch the command-line version.

👉 CLI uses **ANSI color codes**; recommended to run in a terminal or command prompt supporting colors.

------

### 2️⃣ **Run GUI Interface**

```bash
python app.py
```

When prompted, enter `G` (GUI) to launch the graphical interface.

Alternatively, run directly:

```bash
python views/gui_view.py
```

------

## ⚙️ Requirements

✅ Python 3.7+
✅ Tkinter (included in Python standard library)

For Linux, if Tkinter is missing:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

(Windows and macOS usually have it pre-installed)

------

## 📚 Data Storage

Student data is saved in `students.data` (pickle format).
 Deleting or clearing this file will result in loss of stored data.

The admin's "clear database" option will also reset this file.

## 🧩 Notes

✅ Supports running both CLI and GUI concurrently (multithreaded)
✅ CLI color output works on **Linux / macOS / Windows Terminal / VSCode Terminal**

⚠️ If colors do not display properly in Windows Command Prompt, try using **Windows Terminal / PowerShell / VSCode Terminal**.
